# AcTOL: Provable Ordering and Continuity in Vision-Language Pretraining for Generalizable Embodied Agents

This repository provides the official implementation of **NeurIPS 2025 Poster "Provable Ordering and Continuity in Vision-Language Pretraining for Generalizable Embodied Agents"**. 

## ðŸ”¥Abstract
Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments across varying numbers of demonstrations show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

To evaluate the language conditioned visual reward:
```python

import AcTOL
import torch
from PIL import Image
# Load AcTOL model

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = AcTOL.load("AcTOL", device=device)

image = Image.open("Your Image Path Here")
text = "Your Instruction Here"

with torch.no_grad():
    image_features = model.encode_image(image)
    text_features = model.encode_text(text)
    reward = model.get_reward(image, text)
```
To evaluate the language-conditioned behavior cloning, please refer to the evaluation code of [R3M](https://github.com/facebookresearch/r3m/tree/eval/evaluation).
